# Cornhole-Stat-Collection

## Author: Christopher Hein

As a data driven individual, I was interested in seeing the performance of the players at my cornhole events over time. I use a website/phone app called [Scoreholio](https://scoreholio.com/) to run my events and track my players. The downside to Scoreholio is that it does not give organizers an idea of a player's performance over the course of multiple events. However Scoreholio outputs the bracket outcome of each event. I was inspired to apply some basic data cleaning and analytics to the files from the events I have run thus far. The script is designed so that anyone can easily download and run the script on their Scoreholio outputs as well. All they need to do is point the input and output locations to the corrrect directories on their computer and it will properly aggregate the playuer's names and performance into a new dataframe and spreadsheet.
